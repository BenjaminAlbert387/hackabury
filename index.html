            <h2>Will we be fed?</h2>
            <p>
                There will be food provided on both days. <br>
                We will serve pizza in the SU at 5pm on the Tue, you can then either go home and continue working together online. <br>
                Or make plans to stay in a single location to carry on working. <br>
                There is no expectation that you would stay overnight at uni - plus the building will close! <br>
                But you are welcome to keep working! <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>What are the themes or challenges?</h2>
            <p>
                You will find that out on the day. <br>
                But if you join the Discord... <br>
                We will reveal who the sponsors are throughout the coming weeks! <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>What is the structure and format of the event?</h2>
            <p>
                Students will arrive at 9.30am for registration, with a 10am start time. <br>
                Industry Sponsors will give a short presentation of their challenges. <br>
                Students then have 24hrs to respond to the prompt idea, in teams, using whatever methods they choose. <br>
                The event is designed to be fun and engaging, with students able to flex their creativity and learn new skills along the way. <br>
                On the second day, hacking will stop around lunchtime, and we will all come together for presentations of the projects made. <br>
                Judging will take place, and the winners and prizes will be announced! <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>What are the steps to register and participate?</h2>
            <p>
                Students need to complete the registration form by 5pm on 28th April. <br>
                <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/events/2025/hackabury-cccus-hackathongamesjam" target="_blank">Register here!</a>.
                They will then be emailed further joining instructions. <br>
                Students can also join the Discord to chat in advance of the event. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Any prerequisites or requirements for joining?</h2>
            <p>
                It would be helpful to get a team together, but don't worry if you come as an individual. <br>
                We can help teams form on the first day! <br>
                You do not have to be an experienced coder, this event is aimed at everyone! <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>What stuff should I bring?</h2>
            <p>
                A laptop - its a Bring Your Own Device event! <br>
                Some snacks and drinks - you'll be working from 10am Tue until 5pm Wed (you can go home in between!) <br>
                Get a team together, best to sign up with a team in mind, but you can also sign up as an individual. <br>
                Your best ideas and all your amazing tech talent! <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>What are participants expected to do during the event?</h2>
            <p>
                You will have 24 hours to build something, it can be anything you want! <br>
                We want you to have fun. And maybe learn something along the way. <br>
                Students will then post their projects on DEVPOST (details to follow), and the final projects will be judged by the industry sponsors. <br>
                We will also have masterclasses and workshops throughout the two days, which you can take part in. <br>
