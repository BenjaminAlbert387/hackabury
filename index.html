            <p>Hackabury is your platform for creativity and innovation. Explore our team and FAQs, as well as our sponsors!</p>
            <h3>What is CCCU's Hackabury?</h3>
            <p>Hackabury is CCCU's hackathon. A Hackathon is an exciting, fast-paced event where participants collaborate in teams to 
            solve real-world problems through coding, design, and innovation. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to develop new skills, network 
            with peers and industry experts, and showcase your creativity!</p>
            <p>This year's Hackabury also contains a GamesJam for our Games Design students. This means that, as part of the Hackathon,
            you can produce games during the time period too!</p>
            <p>For more information about Hackabury, check out our FAQ page.</p>
